This directory will contain private files encrypted with my gpg keys.
Things like hostnames, urls, machine-used passwords, etc. should go
here.

I'll do my best to maintain anonymized version of these to make sure it's clear
what type of data each file stores. For example `password-store.private`
contains an URL where I store my password store, which I consider sensitive
information. `password-store.anonymized` contains an examplar path to GIT repo.
